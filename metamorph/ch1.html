  <h1 align="center">==> INTRO</h1>
  <blockquote>A story where moon-crossed siblings switch roles, a gamer gains a friend before a found family, and two ghosts learn to stop being haunted by the sea.</blockquote>
  <br><hr><br>
  <p>The grief was too strong.</p>
  <p>He’d lost both his brothers in a single night, and worse still was the organization’s unforgiving insistence that one of them betrayed the other. It took him all his mental fortitude to keep his faith in December, to not be dragged under by the belief that he did turn traitor and kill August.</p>
  <p>But he couldn’t keep it up much longer.</p>
  <p>Every hour that passed since the interrogations, the poking and prodding at the cracks in his armour—every second that passed, he felt the hatred grow in his heart. Almost palpable, throbbing, crying out for revenge.</p>
  <p>April sat with his elbows on his knees, his forehead pressed to his wrists. Clasped tightly within his hands is a small glass vial. August’s last gift to him.</p>
  <p><i>Gift</i>. He smiled, lopsided. What a funny word.</p>
  <p>If his grief threatened to turn himself against December, then better for him to die before his hunger for revenge consumed him from the inside out.</p>
  <p>He felt sorry for the one colleague he had struck up a friendship with, as shallow as it was both ways. Hopefully his cheeky junior wouldn't blame April’s disappearance on himself.</p>
  <p>“See you soon, August.”</p>
  <p>He brought the rim of the vial to his lips and tipped his head back.</p>
  <br><hr><br>
  <p>“Chigasaki.”</p>
  <p>Itaru nearly spat out the coffee in his mouth, coughing into his sleeve as Chikage patted his back.</p>
  <p>“Sheesh, senpai. Don’t scare me like that.”</p>
  <p>Why an office worker felt the need to mute his footsteps, he had no idea. But Itaru wasn’t one to judge. Against all reason, having these breaktime chats with Chikage had become a natural, even enjoyable, part of his day.</p>
  <p>“What’s the name of that singing robot girl you like to listen to? Saki Fujita?”</p>
  <p>He nearly spat out his drink again. Inwardly declaring it a lost cause, Itaru abandoned his half-empty cup on top of the coffee machine and shot a strained smile at Chikage.</p>
  <p>“Okay, first of all, she’s Miku Hatsune and Saki is her voice provider, how did you know one but not remember the other—secondly, why are you even asking me this?”</p>
  <p>Chikage hummed, giving a noncommittal shrug. “I was thinking about wordplay in songs, and there’s that one Miku song that used both the English and German meanings of a word, right?”</p>
  <p>Itaru gave him a bewildered stare. Chikage took that to mean he wasn’t being specific enough.</p>
  <p>“It was about a girl with insomnia? Secretly a serial murderer? Come on, you know the title.”</p>
  <p>“…‘Gift of the Princess Who Brought Sleep’? Setting aside the fact that you apparently listen to Vocaloid music, of course you would be interested in <i>that</i> kind of song, I shouldn’t be surprised at this point.”</p>
  <p>“What kind of person do you take me for, Chigasaki?”</p>
  <p>At Chikage’s raised eyebrow, Itaru repaired his princely smile, dismissively waving his hand in front of him. “A respectable member of society. I was just kidding. Any reason you brought this up, or are you trying to make fun of me like always?”</p>
  <p>“Ah, I just got a <i>gift</i> from one of the company’s business partners the other day. Some German wine, by the looks of it. Made me wonder if they were trying to assassinate me through poisoning.”</p>
  <p>Itaru snorted. “You sure have a morbid sense of humour. Want me to lend you the light novel based on the song? You might even enjoy it.”</p>
  <p>“No thank you, I’d rather not turn into a full-fledged nerd like you.”</p>
  <p>“Whatever you say, senpai.”</p>
  <p>The both of them checked their watches, parted ways, and returned to their respective departments. All in all, yet another small surprise in an otherwise everyday exchange.</p>
  <p>And then Chikage didn’t come to work the next day. Or the day after that.</p>
  <p>And as his absence spilled into a week, rumours flying everywhere among the staff while the higher-ups tried to figure out how to fill the void of one of their most valued employees, Itaru regretted that he should have picked up on the hidden meaning behind his senpai’s parting words.</p>
  <p>Maybe he was reading too much into it. Maybe it was just an unlucky coincidence.</p>
  <p>Still.</p>
  <p>With a sigh to hide the restlessness in his heart, he pulled up the company’s website and clicked on the link to the staff directory page.</p>
  <p>“You owe me big time, senpai.”</p>
  <br><hr><br>
  <p>He brought the rim of the vial to his lips and tipped his head back.</p>
  <p>But it wasn’t meant to be.</p>
  <p>Either because of his nerves and his shaking fingers, or a subconscious refusal to die, the glass bottle slipped out of his hands and fell to the ground, its contents draining into the soil.</p>
  <p>December cursed himself. There was no point to living in a world without August, and yet his stupid traitorous body chose life regardless of his will.</p>
  <p>“It’s pointless anyway…” August’s smug rasp echoed in his ears. “That drug…”</p>
  <p>“Shut up.” December hissed through gritted teeth, lifting himself up on one knee. “He’ll kill me anyway if I stay here with you.”</p>
  <p>Light footsteps came to a stop just a few meters away. December raised his face to glare at the traitor, though he had to squint his eyes against the moonlight.</p>
  <p>“And why would I do that? It’d be more fun to see your <i>‘family’</i> tear each other apart over your death, right?”</p>
  <p>That hateful smile curved wider at August’s desperate cry and December’s defiant yell. But before he could take another step, August grabbed December and, with a final burst of strength, thrust him over the edge of the cliff behind them.</p>
  <p>December couldn’t even scream as he fell, the air shocked out of his lungs.</p>
  <p>The last thing he saw before crashing into the cold ocean waves was August’s gentle smile backlit by the moon, his lips soundlessly forming around one word.</p>
  <p>(—Live.)</p>
  <br><hr><br>
  <p>“Hey senpai where are you right now—what do you mean ‘who are you’ we talk every day you know what my voice sounds like—okay calm down I didn’t mean to blow up at you like that—seriously though where are you like nobody’s seen you for a week—you don’t know?? How can you not know where you are?? Send me the location in LIME I’m gonna drive there right now—”</p>
  <p>Drumming his fingers on the steering wheel, Itaru constantly glanced over to his phone screen. The location displayed on the map was unfamiliar to him, a neighbourhood he didn’t really expect Chikage’s residence to be in.</p>
  <p>But then again, what did he know about Chikage anyway? The man a) told lies like breathing air, b) never showed his teeth when he smiled, and c) rejected all the advances the women (and sometimes men) in the office made on him.</p>
  <p>Basically everything Itaru himself did, so he was probably hiding something along the same lines as Itaru’s gamer persona Taruchi.</p>
  <p>Oh, add one more to that list: d) knew about Taruchi and kept that secret between them, even indulging Itaru in his hobbies sometimes.</p>
  <p>So all in all, Itaru considered him at the very least an amicable coworker whose presence he enjoyed. A <i>friend</i>, even.</p>
  <p>When his phone’s GPS told him he was closing in on his destination, he slowed down, scanning the houses for any sign of Chikage. Spotting familiar green hair in one of the windows, he breathed out a sigh of relief, parked in the driveway, and got out of the car with his fists balled by his sides.</p>
  <p>“Yo, what the fuck?”</p>
  <p>Slamming the door open, Itaru felt a little bit guilty at the way Chikage flinched. Nevertheless he marched right up into Chikage’s personal space, ready to give him a piece of his mind.</p>
  <p>Before he could say anything, Chikage opened his mouth and asked, voice quivering in a way Itaru had never heard before, “Do you know who I am?”</p>
  <p>“…No way. Real world memory wipe plot twist flag get.”</p>
  <br><hr><br>
  <p>December woke up gasping, both hands clutched to his chest. His heart felt like it was trying to escape his ribcage with how fast it was pounding, echoing loudly in his ears.</p>
  <p>“Where…?” His gaze flicked wildly around, taking in the room he was in. Wide bed, soft sheets, glass windows exposing the city skyline. Judging by the height of the surrounding buildings, he was currently in some high-rise condominium.</p>
  <p>Last he remembered was the frigid night sea stealing his consciousness away, but now the sun was high up in the sky, casting warmth on his skin.</p>
  <p>“Oh my, you’ve finally woken up.”</p>
  <p>December immediately turned his attention to the stranger entering the room, putting up his guard out of ingrained habit. “Where?” He repeated, keeping his sight trained on the man. The stranger’s slender physique gave off an air of harmlessness, but one could never be too careful, especially in his line of work.</p>
  <p>“Where? I suppose you don’t remember me coming across you, washed up on the beach. You gave me quite the scare.”</p>
  <p>He narrowed his eyes. “…Shouldn’t you have taken me to the hospital. Or the police station.”</p>
  <p>The stranger laughed softly. “When I offered to, you were the one who begged me otherwise, so I brought you back to my home. It surprised me to see how steady you were on your feet, considering your circumstances and how you were half-asleep the whole time.”</p>
  <p>That came as no surprise. He had trained his body to be able to keep moving even if his mind lagged behind.</p>
  <p>The problem now was that he <i>clearly</i> didn’t come off as an ordinary person, yet the stranger hadn’t yet pointed out how suspicious he was. Rational people wouldn’t involve themselves in what was clearly a shady situation. Real life wasn’t that kind.</p>
  <p>Still, December was alive, and he was taken care of. Relaxing his tense limbs just a tiny bit, he swung his legs over the side of the bed and raised himself onto shaky legs, holding up a hand to stop the stranger from coming closer.</p>
  <p>“Thank you for the help, but it’s not safe to be around me. And there’s somewhere I need to go.”</p>
  <p>The stranger nodded. “Of course. Where to?”</p>
  <p>December gave him a bewildered stare. Apparently, the stranger took his silence as a cue to continue talking.</p>
  <p>“Fufu, forgive my boldness, but I admit that I’ve developed a sort of… protectiveness, over you.”</p>
  <p>“I could kill you with my bare hands.” December instantaneously replied, then winced and backpedalled. “Sorry, I don’t know what came over me. I don’t need to be protected. If anything, I should protect you from myself.”</p>
  <p>“So you admit you would protect me?” Laughing again, the stranger sat down on the foot of the bed, twirling a lock of his ponytail between his fingers. “The feeling is mutual, then. Indulge me, won’t you?” His golden eyes took on a mischievous gleam. “Or would you rather I report you to the police?”</p>
  <p>“I could kill you with my bare hands.” December repeated, but the words felt like an empty threat now.</p>
  <p>“<i>Will</i> you?”</p>
  <p>“…No.”</p>
  <p>“Then there you go.”</p.>
  <p>Standing up, the stranger held out his hand. And no matter how much his mind warned him not to, (he loathed the idea of involving a civilian, and the thought of being indebted to someone made his skin crawl,) December reached out and took it, which only made the stranger’s smile curve wider.</p>
  <p>“Where to, little ghost?”</p>
  <br><hr><br>
  <p>Over the course of an hour, Chikage got to know his own identity in bits and pieces, though it was largely an incomplete picture.</p>
  <p>He was Chikage Utsuki, an elite salaryman who worked at a major trading company and had a junior in a different department, Itaru Chigasaki, who considered him a friend. He told lies like breathing air, never showed his teeth when he smiled, and rejected all the advances the women (and sometimes men) in the office made on him.</p>
  <p>And, Itaru emphasized, he knew about Itaru’s gamer persona Taruchi and kept that secret between them. Chikage felt like perhaps that last fact didn’t really need to hold <i>that</i> much weight, but with Itaru’s grave expression and the way he spoke of it, maybe there was more to it than just that.</p>
  <p>“So, you think one of the company’s business associates tried to assassinate me through poison, but somehow I survived with the side effect of losing all my memories? That’s absurd.”</p>
  <p>Itaru dragged a hand down his face in exasperation. “I know it sounds stupid, but that was literally what you told me before you went off and disappeared for a whole week. I thought it was just a shitty joke at the time but now I don’t know what to think.”</p>
  <p>He then looked around the room they were in, taking the time to properly scrutinize his surroundings since his attention had been solely focused on Chikage the moment he barged inside.</p>
  <p>Calling it modest was an understatement. The living room—if it even counted as one—felt very much unalive, what with the bare cement walls, lone lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, and a single couch and table that looked like they had seen better days. Was the bedroom the same way? The kitchen?</p>
  <p>Granted, Itaru’s own apartment was rather bare-bones considering his priorities, but at least it felt lived-in.</p>
  <p>“Damn dude, you live like this?”</p>
  <p>Chikage shrugged. “There was a lot of dried food stashed away in the cupboards. I didn’t really want to go out, taking into account the whole <i>amnesia</i> thing. It was running low though, so I’m glad you came.”</p>
  <p>“Not what I meant but okay.” Itaru’s thoughts snagged on a point. “Why did you answer my call? Scratch that, why didn’t you answer any of our bosses’ calls before that?”</p>
  <p>“After the first one started yelling in my ear about missing work and troubling the company, I blocked the number. And the numbers of all the similar-sounding calls after that.”</p>
  <p>“Holy shit. You are <i>so</i> fired.”</p>
  <p>“I suppose so.” He didn’t look all that bothered by that fact. Which, honestly? Hashtag relatable. “But now I don’t know what to do.” Turning his gaze to Itaru, Chikage put on his best doe-eyed face and asked, “Since you seem to know me quite well, can you help me?”</p>
  <p>Itaru already had his phone out and was snapping pics as fast as he could with one hand, since the other hand was currently preoccupied with shielding his eyes from the gap moe explosion happening right in front of him.</p>
  <p>“You’re killing me, senior. Special event SSR dere CG get.”</p>
  <br><hr><br>
  <p>December let out a string of curses under his breath. There were no signs of life at the hideout.<p>
  <p>The front door was unlocked, which was never a good thing. The food stores were almost completely depleted, which meant that April had stayed cooped up inside for a good part of a week before he left. There were no obvious traces of a struggle, which alleviated some of his concern, but that didn’t mean anything unless he could confirm April’s safety with his own eyes.</p>
  <p>He had already lost August. The mere thought of losing his only remaining family made his head spin and his breath quicken.</p>
  <p>No, he couldn’t falter here. Creeping over to the bedroom, he twisted the knob as silently as he could. The lock rattled, holding fast.</p>
  <p>Huffing, December returned to the living room and heaved the sofa to the side, revealing a loose floorboard. Not a minute later, the skin under his nails started to bleed, but he had managed to jiggle the board free, retrieving a rusty key hidden underneath.</p>
  <p>He slunk back to the bedroom door and unlocked it, holding his breath as he pushed it open.</p>
  <p>Nothing. Small mattress, wooden crate in lieu of a table, shadeless lamp. No April. He already knew April wasn’t here, but it made his heart ache nonetheless.</p>
  <p>However, there were multiple sheets of paper strewn across the floor, messy handwriting scrawled all over them. December picked one up and tried to decipher the words. Guilt ate at his stomach with every sentence.</p>
  <p>Apparently, not long after the mission had gone awry, the organization had Chikage taken to the headquarters. The notes wrote that it was for questioning, but it was clear that the true intent was to implant the notion that December betrayed August in April’s head. From the looks of it, April held out for as long as he could, but the grief was too strong.</p>
  <p><i>Better for me to die before my hunger for revenge consumes me from the inside out.</i></p>
  <p>Did he take the suicide drug that August gave them, meant as a last resort?</p>
  <p>But that night, August said—</p>
  <p>(“It’s pointless anyway… That drug…”)</p>
  <p>December clung to that shred of hope. There was no point to living in a world without August, and yet his stupid traitorous body chose life regardless of his will. Hopefully, April was the same.</p>
  <p>What now, though? The organization likely wanted him dead, and he didn’t particularly want to return to that life after what they made him go through. But he had nothing else to himself. Nothing but the clothes on his back, the fake name August gave to him, and the faint hope that April was still alive somewhere.</p>
  <p>He relocked the bedroom door behind him and stumbled out of the house, where slender yet surprisingly strong arms caught him before he could fall to the ground.</p>
  <p>“Oh dear,” the stranger cooed, brushing gentle fingers through December’s hair. “I take it you didn’t find what you came here for?”</p>
  <p>December nodded, feeling smaller and more vulnerable than he had ever been in years. He looked up at the stranger and choked out, “Help me.”</p>
  <p>The stranger smiled. The stranger smiled a lot, December thought, but it never reached his golden eyes, which always seemed to be looking somewhere else, something unseen. December wondered if he was haunted by a memory.</p>
  <p>It would explain his nickname for December too, since neither of them had given their names to each other.</p>
  <p>“Of course, little ghost. You must be very tired. Rest for now.”</p>
  <p>The stranger pressed a hand to December’s face, covering his one visible eye with his palm. December didn’t resist, and as the stranger muttered something he couldn’t quite catch, he let his mental exhaustion wash over him, dragging him into unconsciousness.</p>
